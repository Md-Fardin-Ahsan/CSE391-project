This Panel allows patients to create their account, book an appointment to see a doctor and see their appointment history. The registration page asks patients to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email ID, Contact Number, Password and radio buttons to select their gender.

Doctor’s Panel and Prescriptions
In the doctor's panel, it all depends upon the patient’s appointment request. The main responsibility of a doctor’s account is to approve the appointment and prescribe medicines. As soon as the patient books an appointment, that particular doctor gets a request. Each field contains the patient’s name, gender, email, date, and time. Doctors can cancel or prescribe the appointment. After approving an appointment, the doctor has to fill up certain fields. These fields include the name of the disease, allergies, and prescriptions. After submission, the patient can view his/her prescription and proceed towards bills payment. Besides, the doctor can view appointment and prescription histories.

Admin Panel
In the admin panel, admin has full control of the system. An admin has the right to manage a doctor’s account. And for the removal of the doctor’s account, he/she has to enter the doctor's email address to proceed. The admin can list all available patients, doctors, and their appointments with listed prescriptions. In fact, the admin can have an overview of all records around the system. Admin can view all the prescriptions from each doctor. Besides, admin can perform search functions on each section which helps to filter up the records on time. Additionally, admin can view all the contact queries with names, emails, and messages of each.
